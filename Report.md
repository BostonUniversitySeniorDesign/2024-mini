# Exercise 1:

    For this exercise we installed Micropython and Thonny and then setup our Microcontroller with the resistor and light sensor. An issue we ran into when testing this was not having the resistor and sensor securely placed within the microntroller, which led to us not getting any data when first running the script. After fixing this, we then found the max and min values of this sensor by putting flashlights to the sensor and by putting the sensor in a completely dark drawer. The values we found from this were Min: 2500 Max: 51000.

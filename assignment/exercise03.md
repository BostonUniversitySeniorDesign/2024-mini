# Exercise: Response time measurement and cloud upload

The LED blinks at random intervals.
The exercise_game.py script measures response time.

## Questions

1. Edit the exercise_game.py code to compute average, minimum, maximum response time for 10 flashes total.
2. Upload the response time data to a cloud service of your choice.

The response to these questions is your unique code and results in Report.md in your team's forked GitHub repository.
